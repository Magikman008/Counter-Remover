# Usage 
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey)
2. Go to file "Counter Remover.user.js" and click raw or just click on this [link](https://github.com/Magikman008/Counter-Remover/raw/main/Counter%20Remover.user.js)
# Possible problems
The script erases any number from the title along with brackets from the beginning of the line, so if you do not have notifications and for some reason the title starts with a number in brackets, the script will remove them indiscriminately
